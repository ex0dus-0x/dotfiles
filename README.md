# dotfiles
I keep my configs and dotfiles here, for both public viewing and backup.

## Shell: `zsh`

I am using the `agnoster` theme. Alongside it, I use the `solarized` shell theme, color scheme, and fonts.

## Theme: Paper

I use __Paper__ for theme and icon theme. This is a GTK theme, and is really nice, even on a regular GNOME desktop.

## Desktop: `i3`

Installed:
* i3-gaps
* i3lock
* i3status + i3bar
* i3-style

Really basic beginner rice. Nothing too complex, but simplistic enough for me to get into ricing. I also implemented `feh` to style up my background.

For i3-style, I am utilizing the Solarized theme to match up with my `zsh` config.

## Bar: polybar

I find polybar super cool. My dotfile currently utilizes the `space` [theme](https://github.com/jaagr/dots/blob/master/.local/etc/themer/themes/space/polybar). 

## Music Player: ncmpcpp

[/u/felixsanz](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/69008j/i3gaps_1984/) did a great rice called __1984__, and I really liked the `ncmpcpp` application and config, so I decided to implement it for a music player.
