# dotfiles
I keep my configs and dotfiles here, for both public viewing and backup.

## Operating System: `Arch Linux`

My primary operating system is Arch Linux, built using a `x86-64-efi` image and a `i386-pc` grub bootloader.

__TODO:__ Add configs for silent boot

## Shell: `zsh` with `oh-my-zsh`.

I am using the `lambda-mod` theme, available [here](https://github.com/halfo/lambda-mod-zsh-theme).

If you are going to be using a theme indefinitely, I recommend deleting every other theme.

## Font: SpaceMono Nerd Font 12

This is the font that I use primarily. For Firefox, I stick with a standard `sans-serif` and `monospace` font, but I still like it.

## Theme: Arc Darker

I like the look of Arc Darker. Check it out in the `.gtkrc-2.0` file.

When working with this, use `lxappearance` to set your theme and icon pack.

## Icon: Papirus Icons

Even though they don't really show unless you use Thunar for a graphical file manager, they still work as a good GUI icon pack

## Window Manager: `i3-gaps`

Really basic beginner rice. Nothing too complex, but simplistic enough for me to get into ricing. 

See: `i3/config`. I did quite a bit of work for different keybinds, and also programs to be executed.

## Bar: polybar

Check `polybar/` folder.

## Firefox: Spirits Startpage

This is a modified version of the Spirits homepage, available [here](https://github.com/Catgrills/Spirits), by this wonderful person.

## Music Player: ncmpcpp

[/u/felixsanz](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/69008j/i3gaps_1984/) did a great rice called __1984__, and I really liked the `ncmpcpp` application and config, so I decided to implement it for a music player. 

I also decided to use __cava__, and I used a custom config from a really awesome Cyberpunk rice [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/71p8ja/i3_cyberpunk_af/).

## Miscellaneous

* feh - _used to change background_
* xbacklight - _used with `bindsym` to change backlight with keyboard_
* pulseaudio - _`pulseaudio` with `bindsym` provides fluid audio control_
* rofi - _used to replace `dmenu`_
